Gameplay: isometric 3d tile set of terrain:  fairways, tree hazards and other disc golf course features

Player has extra dice they can use anytime a roll is called for, but once used they lose the extra die. Required rolls always provide the indicated die. Each hole new dice are added for each player. Players can improve their character in different ways at the end of each hole. 

When multiple dice are rolled, player chooses the die to use (allows control for certain penalties positioning)

Terminology:
With advantage \[ x \] means \[x\] bonus dice of the same type are rolled.
With disadvantage \[x\]  player loses the ability to choose and the lowest die is always picked from dice rolled.

Player Features:
Handedness bonus/penalty (Left, Right, Ambidextrous) to maximum throw distance 
Throw style bonus/penalty (backhand, forehand, overhead hammer) to maximum throw distance.
Tree whisperer: a 19 is critical success on tree hazard checks
Semi-Pro: all fairway throws are with advantage \[1\]. 
Pro: all fairway/rough/neutral throws are with advantage \[1\].
Backhand Master (in addition to basic throw style bonus): gets that sweet S shape on throws and significantly increases maximum throw distance.
Forehand Master: ditto
Hammer Master: significantly increases maximum throw distance with hammer throw 
Lucky: Hazard checks are with advantage 
More TBD


Player turn:
Pick target, throw type and hand
Roll D20
20: critical success, automatically passes any tree/shrub/bush hazards, no flight deviation.
11-19: deviate throw angle to the right 11 is worst case
2-10: deviate throw angle to the left, 2 is worst case
1: Critical fail, randomly repositions target (within a radius of original target), automatically fails any tree hazards

Terrain:
Tree hazards: if the disc passes into the zone of a tree hazard and the height of the disc is less than the height of the hazard:
-If player has a critical success already, pass hazard with no deviations
-If player has a critical failure already, drop disc close to the tree hazard on entering side
-otherwise, roll a d20: 20 auto pass as above, 1 auto fail as above. 11-19 punches through with decreased power, 2-10, bounces backwards off tree. In this case worst scenario is close to the hazard.

Gusts of wind:
Roll a new throw from gust
Critical failure: pop up and randomize new target within zone of current flight direction (hyzer should be preserved).

Water: standard lose stroke and drop new disc at waterline. No critical successes? Or maybe a water skip with new throw target?

Bushes: only hammer throw or critictal success can be thrown from the bushes. Will trap any low flying discs without a critical success. Max throw distance from bushes is sharply reduced.

Rough: reduce maximum throw distance
Sand: significant reduction in max throw.
Boulders: Automatically bounces back with D20 roll. Closer to 1 is closer to Boulder.
Fairway: increase maximum throw distance
Neutral: no bonus or penalty
